            Bachelor of Science in Computer Science offers three professional elective tracks for students:<br><br>
            1. Core Computer Science<br>
            The Core Computer Science track discusses material in traditional fields of Computer Science not covered by the required courses in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program. It is designed to introduce and explore various areas of computer science study in preparation for graduate studies and research. Course offerings include and may be expanded to special topics in programming and natural languages, cognitive and scientific computing, distributed computing, and algorithms, among many others.<br><br>
            2. Game development<br>
            The Game Development track offers the opportunities for students to showcase their creative and technical skills in the development of a marketable 2D / 3D game. This specialization track places its emphasis on allowing students to explore and learn the many facets of game development. It uses up-to-date and appropriate software tools, from simple animation to packaging the game, in a multi-platform environment.<br><br>
            3. Data science<br>
            The Data Science track responds to the growing needs of the industry to groom competent scientists who are both data- and progress-driven. The track shall prepare students to jumpstart a career in data science through the list of specialized courses developed with inputs both from the research and professional industries. Specifically, students will be equipped with the needed mathematical analysis and professional programming and development skills to create and innovate solutions and processes that will be relevant to the growth of existing industries and of the nation. Additionally, the set of disparate courses will prepare students to undertake advanced graduate studies and research in the areas of computing and decision sciences.

            Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program will offer three professional elective tracks for students:<br><br>
            1. Network and Security<br>
            The Network and Security track provide a continuation of the CCNA modules delivered during the 2nd and 3rd years of BS IT students. They are expected to learn how to manage, build, and install a computer network’s security by understanding and implementing network security policies and procedures.<br><br>
            2. Web and Mobile App Development<br>
            The Web and Mobile App Development track is a supplement to the programming courses that the students are currently taking. Additional programming languages, frameworks, tools, and best practices in software development are to be introduced in this track. Aside from Java, students in this track are expected to learn PHP and .NET Framework. Also, aside from Android, students are expected to create mobile applications using either iOS and/or Windows platforms.<br><br>
            3. IT Automation<br>
            The IT Automation track identifies possible applications for the IT field. The focus is on hardware integration, implementation, and application rather than engineering hardware development and design. Introduction of existing technologies, such as the Boe-Bot series and Arduino, will be used to identify and create possible applications, focusing on real-life scenarios (i.e., Internet of Things).

                        <p class="featuredsubtext content"><strong>(1350-1419), priest</strong>   
                        <BR></BR>
                        <strong>Feast Day: May 5</strong>

                        <br><br>In 1350, Vincent was born in Valencia, Spain to William Ferrer and Constancia Miguel, both nobles.  He was educated in Valencia and at the age of 17 received the habit of the Order of Preachers, and was sent to Barcelona for further studies. Later, he taught philosophy at Lérida and in three years returned once more to Barcelona.  He proceeded to continue his studies at Toulouse,  where, in his own words, “study followed prayer, and prayer  succeeded study”.

                        <br><br>In 1398, Vincent was recovering from a serious illness when he had a vision of Christ accompanied by St. Dominic and St. Francis directing him to teach penance. In the troubled times in which he lived, he was an ‘angel of peace’, a messenger of penance sent to prepare men and women for the judgment. For twenty years, he traversed Spain, France, and Italy, preaching penance and awakening the dormant consciences of sinners by his wondrous eloquence. His austere life was but the living expression of his preaching. Although he preached in his own native tongue to people who spoke different languages, he was clearly understood by all because of his extraordinary ‘gift of tongues’.  He was also outstanding for the ‘gift of prophecy’, worked astonishing miracles and brought back thousands, including Jews and Moors, to the faith.  His authority helped to bring the Great Schism to an end. He spent the last three years of his life in France and died in 1419. Pope Calixtus III canonized him in 1455.

                        <br><br>St. Vincent Ferrer endeavored to inform the people of his time about penance to prepare them for judgment, which he simply yet extraordinarily carried out through spiritual algorithms so to speak:  the ‘gift of tongues’ and the ‘gift of prophecy’. Under the inspiration of its patron, the UST Institute of Information and Computing Sciences declares its commitment to the pursuit of truth and the formation of technically competent Information Technology Education professionals endowed with a strong commitment to lifelong learning, social responsibility and a desire for leadership in the spirit of service.
